This repository contains the foundational setup for a Next.js project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum and serves as the base for building reusable components, implementing routing, and integrating APIs.

The goal is to establish a clean, maintainable structure that supports scalable development using modern web technologies.
